Are you traveling to a new location and you need to check the weather for that location? Well then you are in the right place. if you use the text area and input the name of the city and state that you are visiting then click the fetch weather button. It will then bring up a 5 day forcast for the location that you have chosen. If you then go back and click on the text line you can see a drop down menu of all of the places that you have searched for to make it easier for you to find that location in the future. i hope you enjoy your trip, or just enjoy your day if you are staying local and need to know the weather.
